Tic Tac Toe Game


For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a tic tac toe game using a window form while incorperating a 2d array. I went about this by first creating the two 2d array and used it to model what the game board would look like. It has its own method with values of board spaces. Like the instructions, its an "int" array.

Next I began to translate that into a window form. I used buttons and named each of them like in the array. I modified each of the buttons so that they respond to being clicked. Like in a typical game the clicks are based on turns, the first turn is X, the second is O, and this continues until there is a winner or draw. The program accurately tells which player (X or O) wins or if there is a draw.

Finally, there is the new game button. When pressed, this button resets the board at anypoint without the need to close and reopen the form.

I have screen shots of the code, the program running with multiple test runs, and I attached the code itself.
